# Flappy_Bird
Flappy Bird clone made in Python with Pygame. I am not a professional programmer or anything, so do not be to harsh ;)
On the other hand, I would really like some feedback on my code! Reason why I have not used classes is that I simply have not
learnt it yet. Yet, I will try to implement it into a new version, or just a new project, have not decided yet..
